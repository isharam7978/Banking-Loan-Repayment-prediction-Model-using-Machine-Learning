# Banking-Loan-Repayment-prediction-Model-using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to build a predictive model that determines the chances of a customer(borrower) repaying or defaulting on a loan using ML models .It involves data cleaning, feature engineering to model training and finally predicting the output


objective : 
This model is going to help any banking or financial institutions in following ways: 

1) analyse borrower behaviour and repayment patterns
2) Build predictive models for loan repayment classification
3) Identify key financial & demographic influence in repayment

4) Dataset :
5) We have two datasets  : Dataset 1 is name as Loan_Repayment_Training_Data ,Dataset 2 is Loan_Repayment_Test_Data_NoLabel

6) Workflow:
   1) Data collection & cleaning : Handle Missing Values, Duplicates and outliers
   2) Train Model with use LinearRegression
